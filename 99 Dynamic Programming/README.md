## Tips for Success

- Understand the **problem statement and constraints** clearly.  
- Identify if the problem exhibits **overlapping subproblems** and **optimal substructure**.  
- Practice writing both **memoized (top-down)** and **tabulated (bottom-up)** solutions.  
- Review and optimize space when possible.  
- Solve problems of varying difficulty.  
- Consistency is key â€” practice daily!

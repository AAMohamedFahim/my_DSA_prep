## **13. Tips for Preparing:**
1. **Master Time and Space Complexity**: Understand the time and space complexities (Big O notation) of common operations for each data structure.
2. **Solve Problems on Platforms**: Use online platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeSignal to practice problems related to these data structures.
3. **Focus on Problem Patterns**: Interview problems often follow certain patterns (e.g., sliding window, two pointers, fast & slow pointers, dynamic programming, backtracking). Recognize these patterns and practice them.
4. **Practice Coding**: Aim to write clean, efficient, and bug-free code during practice. Refine your coding style and develop an intuitive understanding of these data structures.

# 🚀 DSA & Algorithmic Problem Solving Roadmap (Java)

Welcome to the ultimate guide to mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** and **Algorithmic Problem Solving** in **Java**. This roadmap is designed to help you crack coding interviews at top companies and build strong problem-solving skills.

## ✨ Why Learn DSA + Problem Solving?

> To clear coding rounds, it's not enough to just know how to code. You must know how to **think algorithmically**, write **optimized solutions**, and choose the **right data structures**.

### Companies That Focus Heavily on DSA:

* FAANG: Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google
* Top Indian startups: Swiggy, Zomato, Flipkart
* MNCs: Microsoft, Oracle, Adobe, Cisco

## 🧠 What is Algorithmic Problem Solving?

Algorithmic problem solving is the **ability to approach problems methodically**, break them into logical parts, and apply the **right techniques or patterns** to solve them efficiently.

### 🚧 Why Learn This Before Advanced DSA?

Before jumping into advanced data structures, you must first train your mind to:

* Understand the **problem requirements**
* Break problems into **input, constraints, and output**
* Apply **patterns** like two pointers, sliding window, recursion, etc.
* Analyze and **optimize your approach**

### 💡 Key Problem-Solving Techniques:

| Pattern                  | When to Use                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Brute Force**          | First approach to understand the problem         |
| **Two Pointer**          | Sorted arrays, pair problems                     |
| **Sliding Window**       | Subarray/substring problems                      |
| **Binary Search**        | Sorted data or search space optimization         |
| **Greedy**               | Make the best choice at every step               |
| **Recursion**            | Break problem into smaller subproblems           |
| **Backtracking**         | Explore all possibilities, undo when needed      |
| **Dynamic Programming**  | Overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure |
| **Bit Manipulation**     | XOR tricks, power of two, binary logic problems  |
| **Prefix Sum / Hashing** | Count frequency or range queries efficiently     |

> Mastering these patterns gives you the **mindset** and **approach** required for almost any DSA problem.
